# Alien-Invasion
My spin on a project out of the book 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. Easy setup: open alien_invasion.py in your favorite Python interpreter and run :)


Get Ready to BLAST 'EM with my version of Alien Invasion:)
I started with a basic template given to me by 'Python Crash Course' and really took it home by making it my own...

I included level-ups on levels 5 & 10, updated graphics, and additional Bonus 'Motherships'. I learned a lot about the pygame module, 
and creating graphic interfaces through Python. I had a ton of fun developing this, and spent more time playing it than I'd like to admit;) 
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
